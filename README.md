# 100 Days of Project 

Welcome to my 100 Days of Project repository! This project is inspired by Huxn WebDev's initiative, where I commit to working on a coding project every day for the next 100 days. This journey is not just about coding but also about learning, experimenting, and making consistent progress in web development.

## About

The 100 Days of Project challenge is a personal commitment to dedicate time each day to work on a coding project. The goal is to improve my coding skills, explore new technologies, and build a diverse portfolio of projects over the next 100 days.

## Rules

1. **Daily Commitment**: Work on a coding project every day for at least 1 hour.
2. **Document Progress**: Keep a daily log to document what was learned, challenges faced, and accomplishments.
3. **Share on Social Media**: Share progress, code snippets, and thoughts on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfProject.

## Project Structure

Each day's work will be organized into a folder within this repository. The folder structure may include:

- **/day-01**: Daily log, code files, and any additional resources.
- **/day-02**: ...

## Motivation

The motivation behind this challenge is to foster consistency, discipline, and continuous improvement. By the end of 100 days, the aim is to have a collection of diverse projects that showcase growth and proficiency in web development.

Feel free to join me on this journey or provide feedback on any of the projects. Let's code and learn together!

Happy coding!
